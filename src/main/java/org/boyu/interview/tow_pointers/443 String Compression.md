# 443 String Compression

## Desc

The compressed string `s` **should not be returned separately**, but instead, be stored **in the input character
array `chars`**. Note that group lengths that are `10` or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

### Constraints

+ 1 <= chars.length <= 2000
+ chars[i] is a lowercase English letter, uppercase English letter, digit, or symbol.
